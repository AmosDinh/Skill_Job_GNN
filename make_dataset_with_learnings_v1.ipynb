The process of creating polygonal hair is particularly useful when creating characters for use in a real-time game engine, where it's not effective to utilize a true hair dynamics system. The focus of this training is going to be on creating polygonal hair which is simple enough to be used inside of a game engine but still has the visual appearance of something that is much more complex. We will start this course by exploring some techniques for creating polygonal hair and styling the hair to have the look we want. From there, we will jump into Adobe Photoshop and create a series of color maps and transparency maps which will give our hair geometry the realism and complexity we need. Finally in the tutorial, we will learn how we can incorporate some subtle shadowing from the hair into our character's face, allowing for a more realistic end result. Software required: Maya 2011.\n",

Yet far too many fail to appreciate the legal and fiscal responsibilities and liabilities associated with it. The stakes are high, but a well-rounded data governance process can help ensure the consistent quality, availability, integrity, and usability of your data. Here Dr. Jonathan Reichental explains how to begin to implement a data governance program within any organization. Learn the components of data governance, its strategic value, the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders, and the overall steps that an organization needs to take to manage, monitor, and measure the program. Plus, get guidance on a set of next steps for building skills. As the data science domain grows, so does the demand for data governance expertise. Start here for your first look at this in-demand skill.\n",

He demonstrates how to create complex screen designs, complete with repeated lists and grids that are as simple to change as they are to create. Once you finish your design, Paul shows how to link different screens together to prototype your app—complete with interactions that transition to different screens and back. The end result is a fully-designed prototype that can be used as the guide for the actual app. Plus, he demonstrates how to share your app with others to receive feedback, and how to export content—artboards, screens, and assets—for use elsewhere.\n",

This is hard enough with one application, but enterprises have many of these applications which often need to work together. In this course, Fast Application Development with WSO2, you will learn how to approach the design of a new application or refactoring an existing application, to use services and APIs to support extensibility, integration, and maintenance of your suite of enterprise applications. Specifically, you will learn how to make data available as a service to your applications, how to integrate disparate systems using messaging and orchestrations and create managed APIs. After watching this course, you'll be able to employ the skills that you learned, allowing you to overcome application complexity and focus time and money on meeting the business's needs, rather than grappling with unwieldy software.\n",
